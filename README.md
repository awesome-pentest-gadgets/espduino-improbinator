ESPduino - Improbinator - Flood of faked 802.11 Probe Request Frames


Background: Living in a town with about 20 wifi-probes mounted on walls in the city center, which collects 802.11 Probe Request frames to measure and map visitor flows through the city kicked off the idea that I could dilute and skew the measurements by flooding the devices with a controlled stream of nearly-real looking but obviously faked probe request frames.

OUI Data: Collected by war-walking sessions around town and other cities and countries - both for client and router OUI's.
